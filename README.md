# Irina Baldwin DRAFT

I am looking for a role in which I can grow as a Full Stack Junior Developer. Having recently completed Makers Academy, an intensive sixteen week programming course, I’ve fallen in love with writing beautiful, clean code. 

My background includes several years of working in and with technology start ups.  Because of this experience, I understand wider business context, allowing me to be more proactive and engaged.  Used to taking full ownership, I will care about your project and will hang in there when the going gets tough.

**Tech skills**: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS (to add)

## Projects (to add)

## Skills

**"Get things done" mentality** - scrappy and persistent, I accomplish objectives with limited resources and little guidance. In my last job and having no experience in software development, I’ve taken on a product management role at a bootstrapped start up of four. I don’t wait to be told what to do, I just figure things out.

**Ownership and responsibility** - you won't need to hold my hand - I am at my best when I can take full ownership of what I am doing. I’ve had a number of roles, where I had to be entirely self-driven.

**Clear communication** - I am a straight-talker, who loves clarity and wins colleagues over with humour, good will and a focus on issues and business objectives at hand. I’ve built good working relationships in every role I’ve had.
