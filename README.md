## Soft Skills

**"Get things done" mentality** - resourceful and persistent, I accomplish objectives on my own initiative and with little guidance. In my last job and having no experience in software development, I took on product management in a bootstrapped start up of four.

**Clear communication** - I am a straight-talker, who loves clarity and wins colleagues over with humour, good will and a focus on issues and business objectives at hand. I’ve built excellent working relationships in every role I’ve had.
