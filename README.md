# Irina Baldwin

I am looking for a role in which I can grow as a Full Stack Junior Developer. Having recently completed Makers Academy, an intensive sixteen week programming course, I’ve fallen in love with writing beautiful, clean code.

My background includes several years of working in and with technology companies.  Because of this experience, I understand wider business context, which means I am proactive and engaged.  Used to taking full ownership, I will care about your project and will hang in there when the going gets tough.

**Technical Skills**: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, PostgreSQL, API, TDD, Agile, Git, Swift, XCode

## Soft Skills

**"Get things done" mentality** - resourceful and persistent, I accomplish objectives on my own initiative and with little guidance. In my last job and having no experience in software development, I took on product management in a bootstrapped start up of four.

**Clear communication** - I value organisation, simplicity and clarity and win colleagues over with humour, good will and a focus on business objectives at hand. I’ve built excellent working relationships in every role I’ve had.
